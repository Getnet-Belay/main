    <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
    <p>
        The German-Ethiopian Textile School (GETS) project is a collaborative initiative between the Association of the North-East German Textile and Clothing Industry (vti) and the Ethiopian Institute of Textile and Fashion Technology (EiTEX), Bahir Dar University. This project aims to enhance the technical competencies of Ethiopian textile industry professionals through targeted training modules addressing key operational areas: fiber knowledge, quality control, productivity optimization, waste minimization, chemical management, and technical textiles. A comprehensive need assessment involving thirteen textile factories shaped the content and structure of the training. This paper outlines the methodology used for need assessment, summarizes the content of the delivered training modules, and discusses the outcomes and impact on the participating textile industries. The results demonstrate that the project significantly contributed to improved quality, productivity, environmental sustainability, and employee skill development — particularly in supporting women’s participation in technical roles.
