    <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
    <p>
        The textile industry relies on fiber mixing and blending to enhance product quality and profitability. Understanding the impact of fiber properties on yarn quality is crucial for maintaining consistent product performance and optimizing manufacturing costs. The inconsistencies in yarn quality and profitability in spinning mills are often attributed to raw material variability, processing conditions, and lot-wise supply challenges. Key concerns include fluctuations in fiber diameter (Micronaire), inconsistent fiber color management, and uncontrolled fiber properties, all of which impact mixing efficiency and overall profitability. This study characterizes polyester and cotton fibers to optimize the production of polyester/cotton (P/C) blended yarns. Virgin polyester exhibited 46.25% higher tenacity compared to recycled polyester, whereas recycled polyester had 30.33% higher elongation. Recycled polyester also demonstrated higher crimp age value and greater crimp age stability, contrasting with findings in previous literature. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis revealed greater chemical degradation in recycled polyester compared to virgin polyester. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed that recycled polyester fibers had a more entangled structure and coarser texture, resembling a spider-web appearance, which affects the fiber's spinnability. The study also examined the influence of drafting force on yarn properties. Results indicated that yarn tenacity improved with adjustments in breaker and finisher draw frame roller settings, with a more significant increase observed for 27 Nm yarn count. Conversely, elongation decreased under these conditions, while irregularity was reduced, particularly for finer yarn counts. These findings highlight the importance of precise process parameter optimization to achieve high-quality P/C blended yarns.
