    <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
    <p>
        The global textile industry is adopting sustainable practices delving into eco-friendly wet processing, “green” packaging and innovative fibers and fiber sources. This study evaluates the potential of agricultural residues, such as banana pseudo-stems, stalks, pineapple leaves, and coconut husks, as raw materials for eco-friendly yarn production. The approach of repurposing agro waste offers dual benefits of mitigating agricultural waste and greenhouse gas emissions while providing a sustainable alternative to cotton. The paper highlights the material properties of various agro-waste fibers, details advanced techniques for fiber extraction, and evaluates their diverse applications in textiles and industrial products. Additionally, the environmental advantages, such as biodegradability and waste reduction, are analysed. The economic feasibility, viz. cost-effectiveness and market expansion opportunities are also assessed. The study addresses challenges of scalability and infrastructure limitations by proposing innovative strategies and policy interventions. This work underscores the transformative potential of agro-waste fiber to revolutionize the textile sector, fostering sustainability and a circular economy.
