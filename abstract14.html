    <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
    <p>
        The global fiber production reached 111 million metric tons, having doubled over the past 20 years. However, the synthetic fibres of petrochemical origin dominate the fiber market. Recently, textile industry has embraced the adoption of bio-based and biodegradable polymers, with the textile market projected to a compound average growth rate (CAGR) of 12 %. Starch as one of biopolymers, has become suitable alternatives to replace petroleum based polymers for industrial applications. Fiber spinning from starch biopolymer and its blends was less attempted using melt spinning which is an industrially feasible method. This study aims on investigating melt spinnability of tapioca starch-based biopolymers into fibers. To achieve this native starch was converted in to thermoplastic starch TPS, further modified with organic acids, and blended with aliphatic polyester, PLA at the later stage. The blends are compatibilized using graft co-polymer to improve miscibility. Rheology and structural study shows improvement in the properties of starch due to thermo-plasticization and high viscosity reduction due to organic acid modifications. Melt spinning trials show the possibility of melt spinning of biopolymer fibers from blends with up to 40% w/w starch content. The melt spun fibers have diameter in range of 12.0–124.0 μm depending on take up speed and TPS_TA content. The overall result from this study shows the possibility of melt spinning thermoplastic starch/PLA blend biopolymers in to fibers, revealing opportunity to utilize starch biopolymer for fiber spinning. Furthermore, the results also show the need for further research engagements to get fibers with better performance.
