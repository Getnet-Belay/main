    <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
    <p>
        This study provides an in-depth analysis and development of sustainable, eco-friendly textile packaging materials, particularly focusing on bio-based biodegradable films. The study examines the physicochemical properties of bioplastics created with different concentrations of fillers and plasticizers. The optimal moisture uptake was found to be 30.95% ± 0.11 for films containing 9% filler and 15% plasticizer, highlighting the significant impact of glycerol's hygroscopic characteristics. The maximum solubility reached 72.53% ± 0.04 at the same concentrations, while lower solubility values indicated possible degradation at higher plasticizer levels. Tensile strength tests showed notable differences between wet and dry states, with a maximum dry tensile strength of 63.41 ± 0.15 MPa, underscoring the critical role of moisture in mechanical properties. Biodegradability peaked at 22.5% filler and 15% plasticizer, achieving a value of 50.34% ± 0.05, which emphasizes the importance of molecular interactions in improving material performance. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) analysis confirmed the presence of functional groups that contribute to structural integrity, while thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) indicated enhanced thermal stability in reinforced samples. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) revealed significant thermal transitions. These findings underscore the potential of bio-based biodegradable films as sustainable alternatives for textile packaging, effectively addressing environmental challenges while meeting the functional demands of modern packaging solutions.
