    <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
    <p>
        This review examines the role of fashion cooperatives in achieving the SDGs, with a focus on sustainability, economic empowerment, cultural preservation, social inclusion, and community development. The fashion industry is one of the largest contributors to global waste and pollution, and is known for exploitative practices and labor violations. Drawing on both published and unpublished sources, the review synthesizes systematic, technical, economic, social, and environmental data from various secondary materials and organizational reports.  This study presents both empirical evidence and theoretical insights to demonstrate that fashion cooperatives marketing a collaborative effort among businesses, non-profits, governments, and communities are an effective tool for promoting sustainable practices and addressing societal and environmental challenges. By analyzing relevant theories and empirical data, the review highlights cooperative marketing’s potential as a strategic approach to drive sustainable development and significantly contribute to the SDGs. It examines key concepts, principles, and mechanisms through which cooperative marketing can enhance SDG attainment. Cooperative enterprises, inherently sustainable and participatory, address critical global issues such as poverty, equality, employment, gender, climate change, peace, and quality education. These cooperatives operate as social and environmental enterprises, fostering democratic knowledge, social inclusion, and resilience against economic, social, environmental, and financial crises. Drawing from a variety of secondary sources, including journals, peer-reviewed articles, books, theses, and conference proceedings, the review positions cooperative marketing as a valuable strategy for achieving the SDGs and creating a sustainable, inclusive future. It provides insights for managers, practitioners, policymakers, and researchers, emphasizing the importance of cooperative marketing initiatives in advancing sustainable development. Additionally, the study calls for further research to address challenges related to social progress and GDP per capita, which remain critical priorities for leaders in government, business, and society. Overall, this review establishes fashion cooperative marketing as a powerful mechanism for achieving the SDGs and promoting a sustainable, inclusive future. These fashion cooperatives provide a platform for designers and artisans to collaborate and share resources, knowledge, and skills. Additionally, they promote ethical practices and contribute to the achievement of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030.
