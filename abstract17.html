    <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
    <p>
        In many parts of the world, especially in least developed and developing countries, shortages of proper hygiene clothing can lead to stigmatization and hinder women's involvement in education, daily activities, and work. By developing hygienic clothing using highly available and low-cost materials, we can help break these barriers and empower women to participate fully in various aspects of life. The main objective of this research was to develop menstrual hygiene management clothing for women by improving cotton fiber’s fluid absorption rate and holding capacity. The cotton fibers were collected and cleaned using a laboratory opening (trash analyzer) machine to remove impurities. The cleaned cotton fibers were scoured to remove natural impurities and mercerized to increase the fluid-holding capacity of the fiber. The scoured and mercerized fiber was opened, lapped, and bonded by stitching. The hygiene management prototype clothing were designed, and the patterns were prepared and cut based on the design. The products were constructed of soft and absorbent fabric at the top, repellent fabric at the bottom, and stitched bonded nonwoven sandwiched between them. Then the properties and performance of produced products were evaluated and explained. The scouring process significantly increased the absorption rate of the cotton fiber, and the mercerization process increased the moisture-holding capacity to 23 g/g. The developed products absorb fluid quickly and hold a high amount of fluid in the core part, which is highly repellent on the outer side. It is leak-proof, and the wash durability of the cloth was good to excellent up to 20 washes.
