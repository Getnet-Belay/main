    <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
    <p>
        An innovative method for functional finishing of cotton fabric combining methanol extract of A. nilotica algae with copper oxide nanoparticles. Given the continuous need to create functional cotton fabric that is both risk-free and highly effective in comparison to alternative techniques, green synthesis nanoparticles have garnered a great deal of interest in the modern world. In the present work, cotton fabric was functionalized successfully with biosynthesized copper oxide nanoparticles and Azolla nilotica algae methanol extract.  Cu2SO4 was used as a precursor and methanol extract both as a reducing agent and combined with CuO NPs, which were applied through the pad-dry-cure method. Characterization was done using SEM, XRD, TGA, FTIR spectral analysis, and UV-vis spectrophotometer. The average particle size obtained was 21.63 nm. Optimization was done using Box Behenken Design while applying the two active agents. Then, the fabric was evaluated for its antifungal and ultraviolet radiation protection.  The optimum value of 20.542mm zone of inhibition of antifungal activities (C. albicans), and UPF with a value of 90.34 was obtained. Therefore, CuO NP and algae extract-coated cotton fabric can be used for medical and other antimicrobial and ultraviolet protection needed applications.
