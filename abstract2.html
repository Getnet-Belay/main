    <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
    <p>
        The high prevalence of visual impairment in Africa poses significant challenges to mobility and personal safety, particularly in environments with hazardous terrain. This study presents the design and development of smart sandals equipped with advanced technology to detect and alert users to the presence of sharp objects, thereby enhancing safety and independence for visually impaired individuals. The project adopts a value chain approach unique to Africa, integrating locally sourced materials, community-driven production processes, and innovative technology to create a sustainable and affordable solution. The smart sandals feature embedded sensors and alert systems that proactively warn users of nearby sharp objects, significantly reducing the risk of injuries. Beyond addressing safety concerns, the project fosters socioeconomic development by engaging local artisans, manufacturers, and technology developers. This inclusive approach promotes economic empowerment, job creation, and skill development while ensuring the sandals remain accessible to underserved and marginalized communities. By combining human-centered design principles with a sustainable value chain framework, this initiative underscores the transformative potential of wearable technology to improve quality of life. The project not only mitigates safety challenges for visually impaired individuals but also contributes to broader economic and social advancements across Africa, demonstrating a scalable and impactful model for innovation.    </p>
