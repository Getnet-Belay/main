    <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
    <p>
        This study explores the factors influencing export performance in Ethiopia’s leather and leather products industry, emphasizing the mediating role of product adaptation strategies. Despite, Ethiopia having the largest livestock population in Africa, providing a golden opportunity for a sustainable leather industry and a vision to achieve an ambitious export value of USD 1.6 billion by 2025. The sector has underperformed in achieving national export goals outlined in the first and second Growth and Transformation Plans (2010–2016, 2016–2020) and in subsequent years (2021–2023). An integrative framework to analyze the relationships between firm resources, export commitment, export promotion programs, and export performance. A quantitative approach targeted 97 medium and large exporting firms in Ethiopia, with data collected from 187 top-level managers. Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) was employed to analyze measurement and structural models. The findings reveal that firm resources and managerial export commitment positively influence export performance, both directly and indirectly through product adaptation strategies. Product adaptation strategies significantly enhance export performance. Export promotion programs positively affect export performance but negatively mediate the relationship between product adaptation and export performance. Managers are advised to prioritize product adaptation and allocate resources effectively. Government agencies, including the Leather Industry Development Institute (LIDI), and export promotion agency advised to enhance market intelligence, provide training, and offer financial support. Policymakers are encouraged to simplify export procedures, implement regulatory reforms, and design targeted support initiatives to strengthen Ethiopia’s global competitiveness.
