    <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
    <p>
        This study aims to clarify how synergistic green practices—such as Green Manufacturing Practices (GMP), Green Marketing Orientation (GMO), Green Human Resource Management (GHRM), and Green Investment (GIV)—impact the sustainability performance (SP) of medium and large companies in these sectors, alongside the role of green innovation (GIN). Utilizing a quantitative approach and cross-sectional survey methodology, the research engaged 201 top managers, executives, and heads of CSR and environment through stratified sampling. The hypothesis was tested using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). Results indicate that the aforementioned green practices significantly enhance firms' environmental performance, with GMP, GMO, and GIV displaying a synergistic effect on GIN, whereas GHRM shows no significant impact. The findings also reveal that all practices, except for GHRM training and development, positively contribute to social sustainability performance and have a substantial effect on GIN. While green innovation mediates the relationship between most green practices and environmental performance, it does not mediate the relationship between GHRM training and social performance. Furthermore, GMP, GMO, and GIV positively influence both economic performance and GIN, while GHRM does not significantly affect either area. This research aligns with UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 8, 9, and 12, offering a framework for understanding the role of green practices in achieving social sustainability and providing valuable insights for practitioners to prioritize eco-friendly procedures, improve customer relationships, and reduce environmental impact.
