    <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
    <p>
        With the growing trend in enhancing beauty through healthy means, customers request apparel and home textiles with extra functions, including environmental protection, anti-pollution, and health and beauty care, in an attempt to achieve a more natural and healthier life. Cosmetotextiles development transforms daily ordinary textile products into cosmetically active products, ending the need to actively apply the cosmetic substance. The textiles can act as delivery systems of bioactive compounds such as vitamins, peptides, antioxidants, fragrances, metallic compounds, and drugs, as well as some animal and plant-based compounds. Active ingredients are normally integrated with textiles by microencapsulation, plasma, sol-gel, dope insertion inside the synthetic fiber via spinning processes or they are applied by coating/grafting or impregnation onto the finished fabric in order to stabilize the cosmetic ingredients, provide sustained skin therapy, and prolong dermo cosmetic efficiency. Current cosmetotextiles in the market claim to be moisturizing, cellulite reducing, perfumed, body slimming, energizing, rejuvenating, refreshing, UV protective, anti-ageing, improving the firmness and elasticity of skin or reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.  The market for cosmetic textiles is growing, particularly in response to the increased demand for hygiene products and the need for extra hygienic and cosmetic benefits in personal care products. Thus, the development of novel applications of cosmetotextiles will open up new market potential for textile and garment manufacturers. This article provides an overview of the development history, important cosmetic ingredients and their applications, and commercial cosmetotextile products available in the market. </p>
