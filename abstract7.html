    <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
    <p>
        This paper gives an overview of Nigeria Textile Industry, identifies the challenges and highlights possible solutions that will revive the industry. The Nigeria Textile Industry used to be the largest employer of labour, second to government and has always been major player in the manufacturing sector of the economy. However, today , the textile industry has ceased to be an important contributor to foreign exchange earnings and employment generation in Nigeria due to inadequate power supply, inconsistent government policies, rampant smuggling of foreign textile, insecurity, etc. Attempts at reviving the sector through fiscal    policy and monetary intervention seem to go nowhere. This indicates that Nigeria  operating environment is still very hostile to the textile sector . The challenges currently facing the industry are multifaceted and the need to revive the Nigeria textile sector in order to boost the economy cannot be overemphasized. Revival of the textile industry will require a strong political will, commitment and sincerity of purpose by the government. If all the problems affecting the industry can be tackled decidedly and holistically, the Nigerian Textile Industry will be resuscitated for sustainable development. </p>
