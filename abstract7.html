    <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
    <p>
        Ethiopia is a country with an abundance of livestock for the production of leather and leather products. To persuade this agribusiness business, the country currently has around 20 tanneries and 19 shoe manufacturing industries. Various research and reports, on the other hand, have revealed that the Ethiopian leather footwear industry's performance is unsatisfactory due to different issues such as poor raw material quality, inadequate planning and control practices, shoe design quality weakness, and high manufacturing costs.

The aim of the research is to investigate the design-related challenges that the Ethiopian footwear manufacturing industry is facing and to identify areas where the sector may improve its performance. The study used purposive sampling techniques, and questionnaires and interviews were used to collect data from selected footwear manufacturing industries for this study. Most of shoe manufacturing industries in Ethiopia sell their products to both the domestic and international markets.

Hence, the study only focused on domestic market based industries because most of export oriented footwear manufacturing industry don’t have footwear designing section and they are focused on customer orders. The study required data were collected from selected nine Leather Footwear Manufacturing Industries in Ethiopia. The collected data was then analyzed using descriptive statistics.

The analyzed data indicated that most shoe design methodologies applied by the footwear industries have not provided the expected change due to constraints with designing tools and expertise. The majority of industries in the sector lack a qualified design team, and research and development team.

As a result of this lead the industry to concentrate on developing specific shoe products. Similarly, the most industries do not conduct any forecasting or trend studies before launching their new products to the customers; instead, they rely on creating a limited number of product types with similar designs over a long period of time. The data gathered from the case industries, as well as the analytical results, supports the above-mentioned issue of low performance in the footwear industry.

To enhance the Footwear Industry's competitiveness and design performance, it is suggested that the Footwear Industry need to establish various training opportunities for its employees that would improve their Footwear Designers capabilities and expertise. Similarly, the industry should establish necessary facilities and a design team as well as a research development team.
