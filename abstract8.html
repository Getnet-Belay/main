    <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
    <p>
        This study investigates the use of animal bone-derived compounds used as sustainable flame-retardant agents. The study used Kombolcha Meat Industry's automatic machine to grind cleaned bones into a fine powder, then sieved to remove larger particles. Mini tab of Taguchi was used to analyze fabric FR efficiency and durability. Nano bone powder was applied to cotton fabric using the conventional pad-dry-cure method with a dispersion agent (Triton x-100) and a binder (Printofix S New, styrene acrylic copolymer) as a binder. Standardized fire testing procedures, including vertical flammability tests, limiting oxygen index (LOI), and thermal stability analysis, are used to evaluate flame-retardant behaviourof the fabric after they have been chemically treated with components derived from animal bones. To guarantee the usefulness of the treated fabrics in daily applications, their mechanical qualities, softness, and general durability are also assessed. Additional bands were detected in the FTIR spectrum at 1720 cm-1 (C=O str.) and 1258 cm-1 (P=O str.), as well as 1078 cm-1 phosphorus-based polymer produced on cotton fabric. Thermal behaviour in nitrogen atmosphere was also investigated and it was found that at 10%, 15%, and 20% bone powder concentrations, respectively, the char yield increases by 18.78%, 33.78%, and 45.39% at 600ºC and the onset temperature of deterioration of treated cotton fabric falls by 37ºC. The auto flammability test at 45 degrees showed that treated cotton fabric self-extinguishes after 18.2 seconds, contrasting with untreated fabric that burns the entire 15 cm sample length.
