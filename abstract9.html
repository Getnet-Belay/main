    <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
    <p>
        Microbial fuel cell (MFC) technology is currently receiving a great deal of attention as a promising and sustainable technology for generating electricity and reducing environmental pollution. However, low energy generation and the cost of producing anode materials have hindered the commercial viability of MFCs. In this work, the double chamber of MFCs was equipped with an anode made of enset corm biomass-waste-derived graphene derivatives (E-rGO). Furthermore, composite-based anodes (E-rGO/Fe3O4 and E-rGO/Fe3O4/PANI) have been developed to remediate Cr (VI) and Pb (II) ions in wastewater while producing energy in order to increase the electron transmission rate. The synthesis materials were analyzed through UV-Vis, SEM, and XRD, FTIR, RAMA and TGA spectroscopy to examine their optical, morphological, structural properties, molecular vibration states, structural defects, and thermal stability of the materials respectively.CV and EIS were also utilized to investigate the electrochemical characteristics of the synthesized materials. For Cr (VI), the anodes made using E-rGO, E-rGO/Fe3O4, and E-rGO/Fe3O4/PANI nanocomposites (NCs) had remediation efficiencies of 70.6%, 79.2%, and 88.3%, while for Pb (II), they were 65.1%, 73.8%, and 86.5%.Furthermore, the composite anode (E-rGO/Fe3O4/PANI NCs) delivered a maximum power density of (63mW/m2) and a current density of (1312mA/m2), higher than E-rGO and E-rGO/Fe3O4 modified anode electrode power density (8.75 and 39.77mW/m2) and current density (609 and 1171 mA/m2), respectively.
